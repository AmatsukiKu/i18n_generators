== FEATURES

This gem/plugin provides following generate commands.

=== 1. Generate Locale Files for ActiveRecord/ActiveSupport/ActionPack

    % rails g i18n_locale ja (de-AT, pt-BR, etc.)

Downloads the .yml file for the specified locale from the official rails-i18n repository:
    https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale

Then the generator sets the application default locale to the specified locale.

This will generate following locale file.

    config/locales/ja.yml

=== 2. Generate Translation YAML File For All Models/Attributes

    % rails g i18n_translation ja (de-AT, pt-BR, etc.)

This will generate following YAML file.

    config/locales/translation_ja.yml

The generator scans your app/models directory, and generates a YAML file with all the AR model names and attributes so that you don't have to write the YAML skeleton manually or by copy/paste.
In addition, the generator tries to translate each of them into the specified language.
The generator doesn't overwrite the existing value so that you can rerun the generator again and again.

=== 3. Generate All

    % rails g i18n ja (de-AT, pt-BR, etc.)

Executes 1 and 2 at once.
